## Description

A mobile application to help users decide their next meal. By entering an address, city, or zip code, users will be presented restaurants within a 1,500 radius of that location. These restaurants are displayed on a map as cards in which users can tap to view more information. Users can also save their favorite restaurants onto their account to revisit in future dates. If users are still unsure on what to eat, they can navigate to the “What to Eat” screen, and with the tap of a button, a random restaurant will be displayed. These restaurants can be filtered by cuisine type, location, and price.
